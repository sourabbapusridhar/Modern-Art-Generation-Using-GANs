# Handwritten Digit Generation Using GANs

The goal of this project is to generate images of digits using a Generative Adverserial Network (GANs). The network is trained and tested on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Requirements
The code is based on Python3 (>=3.8). There are a few dependencies to run the code. The major libraries are listed as follows:
* Tensorflow (>=2.3.0)

## Installation Guide
To install the anaconda environment, navigate to the repository folder, and run the following command in the command prompt:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

## Execution Guide
1. To activate the Conda environment, please run the following command in the command prompt:

`conda activate gans`

2. *To be added*

3. To deactivate the Conda environment, please run the following command in the command prompt:

`conda deactivate`

## Clean-up Guide
